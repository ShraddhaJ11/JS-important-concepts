/**
 * In laymanâ€™s terms, one can imagine a polyfill as a common paste which can be used to fill 
   holes and cracks to smooth out any defects in a wall.

 * For the web, a polyfill does the same thing. There might be some functionality missing in 
   the browser that needs to be added or filled in.

 * A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality 
   on older browsers that do not natively support it.

 * A polyfill (or polyfiller) is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that 
   we, the developers, expect the browser to provide natively.

 * For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element 
   on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 using a Silverlight plugin, or mimic support for CSS rem 
   units, or text-shadow, or whatever you want. The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively 
   is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more 
   and are faster than polyfills.
