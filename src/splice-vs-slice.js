/**
 * The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements
   and/or adding new elements in place.

   let arrDeletedItems = array.splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])

 * The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected
   from begin to end (end not included) where begin and end represent the index of items in that array.
   The original array will not be modified.

   arr.slice([begin[, end]])
